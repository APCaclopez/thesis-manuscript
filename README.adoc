Thesis manuscript written in AsciiDoc with conversion configs/scripts.

== Building

A build script is provided for convenience:

[source,powershell]
----
./build
----

Running this for the first time will prompt you to install LaTeX packages. *Install all of them*.

The build pipeline goes like this:

----
asciidoc -> [asciidoctor] -> docbook -> [pandoc] -> latex -> [xelatex] -> pdf
----

== Depedencies/Setup

Most depedencies are installable using https://scoop.sh[Scoop] (see `dependencies.json`)

[source,powershell]
----
# install scoop
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression

# install dependencies available on scoop
scoop install pandoc miktex msys2 ruby
----

You need to set up ruby for the rest:

[source,powershell]
----
ridk install
----

This will prompt you what to install. *Enter 3*.

Install the rest of the dependencies:

[source,powershell]
----
# install asciidoctor & extension
gem install asciidoctor
gem install asciidoctor-bibtex
----
